# A plugin to allow creator monetization over the Bitcoin Lightning Network


Creators
--------------
Put your lightning address somewhere in your profile. I would suggest the support section of the channel.
use the format ⚡user@wallet like ⚡viralsurgeon76@walletofsatoshi.com
If you don't have a wallet, we suggest https://getalby.com/podcast-wallet for their enhanced creator tools and ability to register the audio feed of your channel with podcast index and get earnings from compatible podcast players.

That's it, just get a compatible wallet, and put that in your About or Support section. 

Viewers
----------------
Get any WebLN browser plug like [Alby](https://getalby.com). Watch videos on a PeerTube instance with the plug in installed. Hit the tip/boost/whatever button, and if the creator has wallet configured, you will be able to directly send Satoshis, which are bitcoin pennies, to the creator. 
if you don't have a compatible browser or plugin, you can scan the provided QR code with your lightning wallet 

PeerTube operators
----------------
Install the lightning plug in from the PeerTube plug in menu. In plugin settings put your wallet address as the system wallet and choose a verb (tip, superchat, boost, rant, bit, spell, whatever your audience will find appopriate).
