# A plugin to allow creator monetization over the Bitcoin Lightning Network


Creators
--------------
Creators can put their lightning address in the description or support section of the channel channel configuraton.
use the format:
    ⚡user@wallet 
such as ⚡viralsurgeon76@walletofsatoshi.com
Creators that don't have a wallet can get an [Alby Podcaster Wallet](https://getalby.com/podcast-wallet) which is preferred for their enhanced creator support at [SATurn](https://saturn.fly.dev/).

That's all it takes to start receiving payments from viewers.

Viewers
----------------
Viewers will need a lightning wallet with some bitcoin. Having a WebLN compatible browser extension such as [Alby](https://getalby.com) linked to the wallet is the easiest way, but they can scan QR codes each time.

PeerTube operators
----------------
Simply install the lightning plug in from the PeerTube plug in menu.  

Optionally they can configure a system wallet with a Lightning Address, and choose a verb (tip, superchat, boost, rant, bit, spell, whatever the audience will find appopriate).
