# Peertube



Creators
--------------
Put your lightning address somewhere in your profile. I would suggest the support section of the channel.
use the format ⚡user@wallet like ⚡errhead@getalby.com
If you don't have a wallet, The most flexible is https://getalby.com/podcast-wallet for their creator tools and support keysend for Lightning Addresses. You can also just use the getalby address as a middleman for privacy and security, just transfer out your earnings.
That's it, just get a compatible wallet, and put that in your About or Support section. You can also register the audio feed of your channel with podcast index and get earnings from compatible podcast players.

Viewers
----------------
Get an WebLN browser plug like [Alby](https://getalby.com). Watch videos on a PeerTube instance with the plug in installed. Hit the tip/boost/whatever button, and if the creator has wallet configured, you will be able to directly send Satoshis, which are bitcoin pennies, to the creator. 

PeerTube operators
----------------
Install the lightning plug in from the PeerTube plug in menu. In settings put your wallet as the system wallet, choose if you'd like a split of any transactions, and choose a verb (tip, superchat, boost, rant, bit, spell, whatever your audience will find appopriate). The split section will allow the sysop to set a percentage of transactions to support operations, not implemented yet.
