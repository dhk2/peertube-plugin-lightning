Creators
--------------
Put your lightning address somewhere in your profile. I would suggest the support section of the channel.
use the format ⚡user@wallet like ⚡errhead@getalby.com
If you don't have a wallet, I'd suggest https://getalby.com for their creator tool support.

Viewers
----------------
Get an WebLN browser plug in like Alby or Joulle. Watch videos on a PeerTube instance with the plug in installed. Hit the support button, and if the creator has wallet configured, you will be able to directly send Satoshis, which are bitcoin pennies, to the creator.

PeerTube operators
----------------
Install the lightning plug in from the PeerTube plug in menu. In settings put your wallet as the system wallet, choose if you'd like a split of any transactions, and choose a verb (tip, superchat, boost, bit, whatever you find appopriate).
